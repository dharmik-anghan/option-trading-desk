"""Keeping the option history current, without being asked.

The options backtest prices from `data/options.duckdb`, and only
`scripts/backfill_options.py` wrote it - by hand, after an expiry. Forget once
and every backtest stops at the last expiry somebody remembered.

This runs inside the desk and does what the script does on a rerun: fetch the
expiries that settled since the newest one held, and nothing else. An expiry is
only fetchable the day after it settles - the endpoint refuses a range reaching
today - so a pass each day picks every one up within a day of it becoming
available.

Only out of hours. A weekly expiry is a few hundred contracts, a request each,
and the desk beside this spends the same Fyers budget on prices while the market
is open.

The first load of years stays the script's job: an underlying with nothing held
is left alone rather than started on a six-hour fetch at app start.

"""Running a strategy over a stored series: everything between a spec and a result.

The engine (`backtest/engine.py`) takes bars and returns trades; this finds the
bars, builds what they are traded against, runs it, and says what the result
should be read with. The API and any script call this - so an engine in another
language slots in behind `run` here without anything above it changing.

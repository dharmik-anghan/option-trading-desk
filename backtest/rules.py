"""Turning a built strategy into something the engine can run.

This is the whole of the bridge: the engine asks a rule what it wants at each
bar, and a spec answers by evaluating its conditions. There is no library of
hand-written strategies, because a strategy is a choice of conditions and those
are made on a screen.

The one piece of judgement here is what happens when both sides say enter at the
same bar. That is a contradiction in the strategy rather than a situation to
resolve cleverly, so it is refused: no position, and the reason says so. Picking
a side would hide the mistake behind a result.

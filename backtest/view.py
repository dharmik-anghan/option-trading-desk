"""What a rule is allowed to know, at one instant.

A rule is never handed a list of bars. It is handed this, and this will not give
it a bar that has not finished.

That sounds like a formality until you write a rule that trades five-minute bars
with an hourly trend filter. At 10:07 the hourly bar covering 10:00 to 11:00 has
not closed. Hand a rule that bar - which any resample-and-index does - and it is
reading a price fifty-three minutes in its future, on every single bar, for the
whole run. The equity curve comes out beautiful and means nothing. It is the most
common bug in multi-timeframe backtesting and the hardest to notice, because
nothing about the output looks wrong.

So closedness is decided here, by comparing times, and a rule cannot opt out of
it. At 10:07 the newest hourly bar this will offer is the one that began at 09:00.

Indicators are read through a `Frame` rather than computed by the rule. The frame
holds one array per indicator for the whole series and returns the value at the
cursor, which is the same number the rule would get by computing over everything
up to now - that is exactly what `tests/analytics/test_indicators.py` asserts -
and it is computed once for the run instead of once per bar.

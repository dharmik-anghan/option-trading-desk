"""A strategy as data, so one can be built by choosing rather than by coding.

"EMA 5 crosses below the close, and RSI 14 is under 30, stop at the previous
candle's low" is a sentence made of parts, and the parts are the same few kinds
every time: something to measure, something to compare it to, and a way to
compare them. Written out as a tree of those parts, a strategy becomes something a
screen can build and something that can be stored, shared and compared - rather
than a Python class somebody has to write and deploy.

    operand    what to measure: an indicator, a price, a pivot level, a number,
               or arithmetic on any of those
    condition  a comparison, or several joined by and/or/not
    spec       entries for each side, an exit, a stop and a target

Three properties this shape buys, beyond not having to write code:

Every operand names its timeframe, so "hourly EMA 50 above hourly EMA 200 while
the five-minute RSI is under 30" is one expression rather than a special case, and
the engine works out which timeframes to align by reading the tree.

Nothing here can look ahead. Operands are read through `Frame`, which only ever
offers closed bars, so a condition cannot reach a price that had not happened -
whatever combination the person who built it chose.

A missing value is never a comparison. During warm-up an indicator is `None`, and
a comparison with one is false rather than an exception or a zero. A rule does not
trade while it is still blind.

"""The run: bars in, trades out.

Everything here is about not flattering the result. The loop itself is twenty
lines; the rest is the difference between a backtest and a sales pitch.

**A decision is made on a close and filled on the next open.** A rule reads bar i
after it has closed, so the earliest it could have acted is bar i+1, and the first
price available then is that bar's open. Filling at the close that produced the
signal is the commonest way a backtest invents money, because it buys at the price
that caused the decision.

**A bar cannot say what happened inside it.** If a bar's low reaches the stop and
its high reaches the target, one of them came first and the bar does not record
which. This always assumes the stop. Pessimistic on purpose: the alternative is a
result that quietly assumes the best of every ambiguous bar, and ambiguous bars
are exactly the volatile ones where it matters.

**Liquidation is checked before anything else.** A leveraged position that went
past its liquidation price during a bar was closed by the venue, whatever the rule
wanted. Checking the stop first would report a loss the trader chose instead of one
the exchange imposed.

**Costs are charged, not netted off at the end.** Fees at both fills, funding at
each settlement crossed, slippage on every fill. They come out of the equity curve
as they are incurred, so a drawdown is a real one.

The engine holds one position at a time. That is a real restriction and a
deliberate one: position sizing, pyramiding and portfolio effects are a separate
problem, and mixing them in here would make it impossible to tell whether a result
came from the idea or from the sizing.

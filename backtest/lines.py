"""Indicator lines for a chart, computed the way the engine reads them.

Shared by the backtest's trade chart and the trading desk's own chart, which is
the point: a line drawn by different code from the one that makes decisions can
be subtly wrong exactly where it matters, and two charts in the same app
disagreeing about where an EMA 20 sits is worse than either being wrong alone.

Everything goes through `View`, so a higher-timeframe line is the last value that
had *closed* - held flat until the next one does. On a backtest that is the
difference between honesty and a lie; on a live chart it is the difference
between what a rule will see and what the chart promised it would.

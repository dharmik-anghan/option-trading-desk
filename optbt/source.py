"""Everything a backtest may ask of the market, and nothing about where it lives.

The engine, the strategy's `View` and the daily context read the market only
through this, so the store behind it - DuckDB today, `optbt/data/history.py` -
can change without them, and an engine written in another language implements
the same questions against the same store. It is a narrow interface on purpose:
a run reads a whole chain only at the moment it enters and then only the few
contracts it holds, so asking is far cheaper than shipping the market across up
front (measured: preloading four years of weekly windows took longer than a run).

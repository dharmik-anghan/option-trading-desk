"""Writing down NSE's pre-open auction every session, without being asked.

NSE serves one session's pre-open - the latest - until the next morning's order
collection replaces it. A day missed is a day lost, so this runs inside the
desk, as the volatility recorder does, rather than depending on somebody
remembering a script.

It asks only when there is something to get: the latest session whose auction
has settled (09:08 IST) and is not stored yet. A desk started at 08:30 still
catches the previous day, which NSE is still showing; a desk started at noon
still catches the morning's. Once the day is in, a pass costs nothing.

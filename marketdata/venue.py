"""A broker's own history, as a bar source.

The bars you trade from. A venue serves a short window - Shark gives a few hundred
candles - so its answers are stored as they arrive and the history accumulates from
the venue itself: a few hundred today, a few hundred overlapping tomorrow, and after
a month a month of the exact instrument the position is in.

That is the whole fix for a short history, and it needs no other source. Yahoo and
Binance are for context and for seeding what does not exist yet, and neither quotes
what Shark quotes - its gold is a perpetual where Yahoo's is a dated contract 0.8%
away, and its Bitcoin carries funding where Binance's is spot.

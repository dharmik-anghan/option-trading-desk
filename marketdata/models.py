"""Bars, and what identifies a series of them.

Deliberately not tied to a venue. The desk has two brokers with their own history
endpoints and now a third source that is neither, and the point of this package is
that a candle is a candle: one store holds them all, keyed by where they came from
so that two sources disagreeing about gold does not silently merge into one series.

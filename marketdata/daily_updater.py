"""Keeping the stored daily bars current, without being asked.

The rotation graph and the volatility ranks read daily bars from the store and
nothing else, and the only thing that wrote them was `scripts/backfill_nse.py` -
run by hand, with the desk stopped, because DuckDB lets one process hold the
file. So the graph sat at whatever day that was last done.

This runs inside the desk, which already holds the store, so it can write where
the script could not. After the close it asks Fyers for each symbol's missing
days - from its last stored bar to the latest finished session - and nothing
else. Once every symbol has the day, a pass is one query against the store.

The backfill script stays for the first load of years; this only catches up.

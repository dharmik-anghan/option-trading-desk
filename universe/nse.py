"""Indian indices, their sectors, and who is in them.

Two kinds of thing are listed here and they are not the same:

  A **broad index** - Nifty 50, Bank Nifty - whose rotation graph plots its own
  constituent stocks against it.

  A **sector index** - Nifty IT, Nifty Pharma - which is itself a thing to plot,
  against a broad benchmark. "All sectors" is the view that plots every one of
  them against the Nifty 50, and it is the view most people mean by an RRG.

Symbols are given in Fyers' spelling because that is the desk's source for
Indian data, and the index list file names in NSE's, because that is where
membership comes from. Both are written out rather than derived, and both were
checked against the live source rather than assumed, because neither naming is a
rule - each is a history.

NSE's list names: `ind_niftyfinancelist` for financial services,
`ind_nifty_privatebanklist` with an underscore where its neighbours have none,
`ind_niftymidcapselect_list` with the underscore somewhere else again. Guessing
produced an HTML error page three times out of fifteen.

Fyers' index symbols: `NIFTYCONSRDURBL` for consumer durables, `NIFTYOILANDGAS`
spelled out where the list file says `oilgas`, and `NIFTYFINSRV2550` for the
financial services index. Three of twenty were not what they looked like.
